# **Understanding Viewing Patterns on Netflix Platform**

## **Introduction**
Understanding viewing patterns on streaming platforms provides valuable insights into entertainment preferences and daily routines. Analyzing Netflix viewing data from my family allows for an in-depth exploration of entertainment choices, routines, and habits. This study aims to identify peak viewing times, compare weekday and weekend behaviors, and uncover seasonal trends in content consumption.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains various aspects of Netflix viewing activity, including clickstream logs, content interactions, user profiles, devices used for streaming, IP addresses, and engagement with Netflix's gaming content. Clickstream and content interaction data reveal details about what was watched, paused, or skipped, while profile information helps differentiate viewing habits among users. Additionally, device and IP address records provide insights into how and where content is accessed, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of streaming behavior. All tables come from Netflix’s GDPR-compliant “Download your personal information” portal. After logging into my account I navigated to Account -> Privacy & Data -> Download your personal information, submitted a request, and received a ZIP file by e-mail a few days later. 

## **Project Goals**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Netflix viewing data to uncover patterns in entertainment consumption. The key goals include:

- Identifying peak viewing times across different days and months.
- Comparing weekday and weekend viewing habits.
- Detecting seasonal trends in content consumption.
- Understanding device usage and profile-based viewing behaviors.

By examining these trends, this analysis aims to enhance the understanding of family entertainment routines and preferences.
